# stphnhthwy.com
Stephen's personal website running on Gatsby, React, Tailwind CSS, and Node.js.

## Note
This site is open source to use for your inspiration, and curiosity. However there is a decent amount of customization in this site, and is not a theme. Take some time to learn and *create your own theme, design and content.* I promise it's worth the effort.
